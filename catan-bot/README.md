# Catan Bot

This project implements a full Python-based simulation of the board game *Catan*, along with two autonomous bots that aim to play the game optimally:

- **MCTS Bot**: Uses Monte Carlo Tree Search to simulate possible futures and select actions with the highest win potential.
- **Reinforcement Learning Bot**: Trained to learn optimal strategies using feedback from simulated games.

The goal is to compare these approaches in terms of gameplay effectiveness and decision quality.
